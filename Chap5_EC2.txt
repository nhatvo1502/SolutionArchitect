EC2
    Web service provides resizable compute capacity in the Cloud
    Reduces the time to obtain and boot new server (instance) to minutes
    Scallable 
    EC2 types:
        On-demand
        Reservced
        Spot
        Dedicated Hosts
    EC2 instance types - Mnemonic:
        FIGHT DR MC PXZ AU - "Fight Doctor Mac Pixzy AU"
        F - FPGA
        I - IOPS
        G - Graphics
        H - High Disk Throughput
        T - Cheap general purpose (T2 micro)
        D - Density
        R - RAM
        M - Main choice for general purpose apps
        C - compute
        P - Graphics (Pics)
        X - Extreme memory
        Z - Extreme memory and compute
        A - Arm-based workloads
        U - Bare metal

First EC2 instance
    Termination Protection is off by default, must turn on  
    EC2's root drive will be deleted when the instance is terminated
    EBS Root Volume of default AMI can be encrypted

Security Lab
    All inbound traffic is blocked by default
    All outbound traffic is allowed
    Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately
    EC2 to Security Group is many-to-many:
        A Security Group can be added to multiple EC2 instances 
        An EC2 instance can have more than one Security Group
    Security Group is STATEFUL: 
        If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again
    Cannot block IP addresses using Security Group, instead NACL
    CAN allow rules, CANNOT deny rules

EBS 101
    - Amazone Elastic Block Store (EBS) 
    - virtual hard disk 
    - automatically replicate within its AZs
    - high availability + durability
    5 flavors:
            -Name-                          -API_name-      -max_IOPS-      -UseCase-
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - General Purpose (SSD):            gp2             16,000          most workloads
        - Provisioned IOPS (SSD)            io1             64,000          databse (better than GP)
        - Throughput Optimized (HDD)        st1             500             big data/warehouse (less IOPS more capacity)
        - Cold (HDD)                        sc1             250             FileServer
        - EBS Magnetic (HDD)                standard        40-200          IA workloads

EBS Volume
    - exist on EBS
    - will ALWAYS be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance
    - can be changed on the fly (size:eg. 500GB->1000GB and type:eg. gp2->io1->sc1)

EBS Snapshots
    - exist on S3 (think of snapshots as a photograph of the disk)
    - are point in time copies of Volumes
    - are incremental:
        - first snapshot takes longer to create (full snapshot)
        - next snapshot will take less longer (incremental of blocks that have changed since the last snapshot)
    - can take snapshot while instance is running but best to stop it first
    - can create AMI from snapshots

EBS Volume migration
    - to move EC2 volume from one AZ/Region to another
    How: take a snapshot -> create an AMI from the snapshot -> move the AMI to another AZ/Region -> launch the EC2 from that AMI
