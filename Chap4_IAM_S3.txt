    S3 Performance
        Prefix - path between bucket name and file name
            \\mybucket\folder1\subfolder1\hello.py      Prefix = \folder1\subfolder1
            Each prefix handles high number of requests 
            Spreading read across different prefixes
        KMS limites
            Upload/download count toward KMS quota
            Region specific quota
            Cannot increase quota
        S3 byte-range fetches to increase performance when download
